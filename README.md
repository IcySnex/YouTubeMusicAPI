YouTubeMusicAPI is a simple and efficient C# wrapper for the YouTube Music Web API, enabling easy search and retrieval of songs, videos, albums, artists, podcasts, and more. It also provides streaming data and access to an authenticated user's library, all with minimal effort.

> ⚠️ **Major Update in Progress: v4 Recode**
> 
> A **complete overhaul** of **YouTubeMusicAPI** is currently underway!
> 
> Originally, this library wasn’t intended to be a fully-fledged API wrapper for YouTube Music. My goal was only to implement basic search functionality so I could add yet another platform to my multi-music downloader, [Melora](https://github.com/IcySnex/Melora).
> 
> This recode is my effort to turn YouTubeMusicAPI into a **clean, consistent, and fully-featured API wrapper** that does justice to everything YouTube Music has to offer - including library management, more detailed information, playback support, and explore endpoints - all while improving performance, efficiency, and code maintainability.
> 
> 📌 You can track development progress in the [`recode`](https://github.com/IcySnex/YouTubeMusicAPI/tree/recode) branch and view planned features in the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/IcySnex/projects/1).
